## Training using tf.keras and tf.distribute parallelized on Kubernetes clusters for CPU and GPU training

This directory contains noteboooks and code for DL training steps of the pipeline.
This shows a few examples and methods deploying TensorFlow/Keras for training using CPU and GPU allocating 
resources on a Kubernetes cluster (cloud).
Training has used the helper script [tf-spawner](https://github.com/cerndb/tf-spawner)

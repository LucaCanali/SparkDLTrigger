## Physics Use Case
Event data flows collected from the particle detector (CMS experiment) contains different types
of event topologies of interest. 
A particle classifier built with neural networks can be used as event filter,
improving state of the art in accuracy.  
This work reproduces the findings of the paper
[Topology classification with deep learning to improve real-time event selection at the LHC](https://link.springer.com/epdf/10.1007/s41781-019-0028-1?author_access_token=eTrqfrCuFIP2vF4nDLnFfPe4RwlQNchNByi7wbcMAY7NPT1w8XxcX1ECT83E92HWx9dJzh9T9_y5Vfi9oc80ZXe7hp7PAj21GjdEF2hlNWXYAkFiNn--k5gFtNRj6avm0UukUt9M9hAH_j4UR7eR-g%3D%3D)
using tools from the Big Data ecosystem, notably Apache Spark and BigDL/Analytics Zoo.

## Data Pipelines for Deep Learning
Data pipelines are of paramount importance to make machine learning projects successful, by integrating multiple components and APIs used for data processing across the entire data chain. A good data pipeline implementation can accelerate and improve the productivity of the work around the core machine learning tasks.
The four steps of the pipeline we built are:

- Data Ingestion: where we read data from ROOT format and from the CERN-EOS storage system, into a Spark DataFrame and save the results as a table stored in Apache Parquet files
- Feature Engineering and Event Selection: where the Parquet files containing all the events details processed in Data Ingestion are filtered and datasets with new  features are produced
- Parameter Tuning: where the best set of hyperparameters for each model architecture are found performing a grid search
- Training: where the best models found in the previous step are trained on the entire dataset.
